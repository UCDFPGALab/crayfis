Chase's code:
    check units and make sure they're consistent throughout code
    separate variables that define:
        left and right edge of graph
        resolution

Github setup
    brainstorm best way to separate a) code b) data c) graphs

Separate code into individual easy-to-work-with files
    1) textToArray
    2) everything else? Separate file for each function?
    add a thorough readme to each file

Run constant blinking at:
    1s (done)
    something much longer (10seconds?) so as to clearly see where the lag is

Put slide together for next crayfis meeting
    explain all data analysis techniques tried so far
    phone blinking results
